# Description

Lightweight Java Multi-File-Type Multi-Directory scraping tool with a pretty GUI for ease of use. The program also gives users the ability to copy/move the result space (based on user inputted directories and file extensions) to a new folder, or delete them, or store the file paths to a textfile for future use.

# Under the Hood
It is made with JavaFX8 and uses Java SE 1.8 features (streams, lambda functions, threading) for the pretty GUI and great performance.

# Requirements
 JRE 1.8
 
# Demo
